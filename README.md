# Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle 

**My Favorite Movie**

The Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle arc is one of the series' most intense and emotional parts. It shows how far Tanjiro, Nezuko, and their friends have come, both in strength and heart.

## Why I Love It 
- The animation quality is absolutely Fire.
- Every Hashira has its shining moment.
- The soundtrack perfectly matches the emotions of each battle.
- It’s not just about fighting demons — it’s about courage, loss, and hope.
